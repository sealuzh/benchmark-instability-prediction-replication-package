Error while executing goptc (27a717152fda18d635414dae32894395750911e2): exit status 2

Out: panic: Error while fetching dependencies for '/home/ext-laaber/go-experiments/data/3f/88/465751/repo/src/github.com/araddon/qlbridge': exit status 2

Out: usage: sync [import path]

sync checks the GOPATH for consistency with the given package's GLOCKFILE

For example:

	glock sync github.com/robfig/glock

It verifies that each entry in the GLOCKFILE is at the expected revision.
If a dependency is not at the expected revision, it is re-downloaded and synced.
Commands are built if necessary.

Options:

	-n	read GLOCKFILE from stdin
